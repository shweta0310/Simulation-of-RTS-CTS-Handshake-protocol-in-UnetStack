# Simulation-of-RTS-CTS-Handshake-protocol-in-UnetStack
RTS/CTS Handshake protocol simulation in UnetStack(a network simulator to run protocols for use in Underwater communication networks).
RTS/CTS handshake technique is used by MAC protocol to reserve the communication channel for transmission of data.

To run the simulation
1. Install UnetStack simulator (https://unetstack.net/downloads.html).
2. Clone this repository.
3. In UnetStack simulator, run the file 'handshake-sim.groovy' from this repository.
